michael keaton killed understatement straight planted bomb thugs pants batman returns  set man fire turbine batmobile  killed joker flat well henchmen  val kilmer killed albeit less keaton  christian bale kill guideline break rule although like twice  look car chase dark knight batman shooting bullets missiles trucks well final chase dark knight rises  batmobile honestly violent thing batman fact

kgbeast  however kgbeast could survived although badly burntscarred  know crossbones could survived explosion building collapse winter soldier see automatically assuming kgbeast dead  cars shot batwing vehicles shot people  although lets say batman achieve high body countthe batman film killed clooney find hypocritical say hate batman love keaton bale even adam west killed guys  violent attitude goes along motivation given hes gotten crueler  comic batman come point well due death jason todd  hush specifically almost killed joker flashbacks  still believe batman basically punisher ask  brand exist death warrant kill  goes along bales im going kill save  kill criminals give mercy theyre prison  know used gun knightmare future last response  point another spot pulling gun bad guy count unless uses gun shoot someone  stab someone though  overall affleck great role  cant rank batmans yet though want see films repeat viewings bvs lets go superman  cavil brings good amount role wish developed clark kent  always found alter egos amazing comic book movies always superman basically  superman lot emotional baggage  theres lot happening really felt sorry character  goes saves little girl burning building still gets torn apart critics put trial  obliges trial lowering human level accept responsibility crimes commit literally blows face  wants prove hes hero cant theres much rooting  wonder smile much film either position  cavil great job given makes ultimate sacrifice show everyone difference powerful good good powerful interactions also well done  fight come pretty late sides show shine  batman completely prepped prepared superman holding holding back  superman try talk batman situation batmans hatred rage whats keeping fight going  superman want fight shown superman stops rolling punches favorite part fight honestly bad ass  thing snaps fight batman finally seeing humanity alien  know whole martha thing getting shit people put position  fighting kill person says save someone happens named dead mother  would stop question bringing name well  thing holds batman back delivering death blow finally sensing humanity alien  thought great see  also fight perfect length  showdowns take 10 minutes easy get taken action  one kept pace quick fight satisfying  subsequent teamwork final fight also cool see superman majority fighting batman distraction  villains  heres expected jesse eisenberg lex luthor  expected man public persona nice eccentric behind closed doors psychopath  expected conversation basically jesse would straight tell superman end human achievement envy different dialogue concept  expected genius way ahead time  got half jesse memorable lot great moments  mansion skyscraper scenes true standouts  definitely genius eccentric psychopath  wish better characterized motivations spelled one big flaws film get  big scene explains hatred superman posing someone good powerful actually moving  jesse gives great performance  times saw lot stuff could annoy people  jolley ranchers scene one  personally saw scene shows able get wants cocky hell  see people finding stupid awkward well   say grannys peach tea scene pretty great

dragon needed fought  monster movie  liked everything except fact know created  almost plan b kill superman batman explained  fight cool  showcased batman superman wonder womans strengths formidable enough adversary bring together formidable enough big cause justice league form take  actually like called kryptonian mutation thats  monster needed taken characterization required  also hilarious mention four different times civilians within fight  side note please never complain civilian casualties comic book movie ever  age ultrons forced ignore killer robot save people falling land mass barely control right feel like cbms going truly go stage nobody danger stakes gone  aside lack explanation creation another problem get script  im really split villains least memorable formidable  supporting im going list character finish summary jl set reality thats wonder woman mysterious definitely standout scene stealer  zack snyder showed great female warrior faora man steel diana prince  small role ever meant extended cameo done limited screen time cant wait wonder woman lois lane  good chemistry henry cavil liked reporter saw lot  also saw lot dangerous situations result reporter like comics  really annoy  line got balls maybe belong dying watch film see mean perry white better characterized man steel  tough editor newspaper company thats slowly dying appreciated character martha kent served well catalyst well preformed dawn justice justice league setup bad actually  way inserted lexs experiments interesting scenes pretty cool  cyborg scene moving seeing silas work son  aquaman audience roaring applause loved cameo cool  flash liked knightmare scene interesting need see  like actors movie really cant say much bad  acting pretty good overall  writingeditingcinematography biggest problems lie  movie edited weirdly would go one scene another back original scene new angle back new thing  also seems scenes cut probably 3 hour cut  biggest problem  wbsnyder listening please know justice league script 150 pages rewrite  honestly snyder terrible job  couple stupid things would better  read jimmy olsen article im keeping anger review  stop

cut lot unnecessary stuff used time build characters  biggest flaw movie  cram everything become disjointed require lot terms story  brings big flaw wb stop using scripts 1990s yeah wanted batmansuperman film  want adaptation death superman  warners  theyve trying hard get films ground since late 90s film finally shows  feel like terrio free range story would lot better softer character moments  dialogue well written  know find cheesy rewrite liked  really feel like character biggest weak point  really implied hinted lot like lexs background batmans cruel nature aside lines wish focus  superman think really best written although batman better portrayed  look back superman part criticized everyone likeness burned course hes going extremely happy hes trying hard make others happy back zack snyder  film extremely well shot  looked beautiful never bored movie really know say ever bored first half movie  cannot expect studio ever release full 3 hour plus movie get

__label__3 review likely going read extremely negative apologize advance  ill say right front  things considered  think theres good batman v superman dawn justice bad easier discuss movies many problems broad sense virtues tend boil specific moments id rather spoil  say certain frustrating film movie supreme high points truly dire low points  epicscale extravaganza sure looking grand superhero mayhem certainly satisfied beyond movie thats ultimately bit lacking  picking 18 months man steel prologue introducing us ben afflecks new bruce waynebatman story  one might guess title  centers around growing conflict batman superman henry cavill conflict influenced heavily one lex luthor jesse eisenberg  nefarious reasons  wants see two heroes battle epic fashion  likes lois lane amy adams waynes trusted alfred jeremy irons even mysterious diana princewonder woman gal gadot along ride two titans grow ever closer trading punches  walking theater two primary concerns one  effort bolster new batman  superman would get kind shafted two jesse eisenbergs lex luthor would ridiculous pose threat heroes  counts movie unfortunately comes short  man steel good film origin story think interpretation superman set character classical vein going forward  thats case batman v superman however superman spends majority film viewed suspiciously everybody including batman lex luthor visibly little joy optimism found way film treats character  fans superman would surely hoping movie would right character kind  filmmakers apparently uninterested giving superman many opportunities know heroic gets standout moments real shame  additionally movie never really gives superman chance defend meaningful way perspectives voiced batman luthor give many people corner rooting aside amy adams lois lane  character also takes enormous amount abuse movie extent actually feels sort perverse carries general tone film mature adult yes also incredibly heavy  kids likely much fun  henry cavill however best expanding profound decency earnestness brought superman man steel hes good guy trying help others right things cavill really pulling conflict batman movie basically stacks deck dark knights favor tries desperately get us side    lex luthor ask  quite simply jesse eisenberg terrible lex luthor  like flatout awful  spastic peculiar performance belongs completely different film  alternating irritatingly arrogant dweeb supposedly threatening mastermind never convincing legitimate threat either superman batman  also help hes saddled screenplays worst bits dialogue various evil schemes totally irrational halfbaked best patently nonsensical worst someone logically explain ultimate goal movie please  hes even fun hammy bad good sort way hes profoundly insufferable  movies problems  chiefly plotting narrative mess characters actions repeatedly unmotivated anything screenplays need act certain way rigidly predetermined story goals feel organic setup  central batman versus superman conflict prime example  eventual fight feel properly motivated anything transpires story  motivated movie studio wanting pit two characters together  though eventually makes visually neat brief fight scene lacks dramatic gravitas emotional heft   also middle hour movie curiously inert compounded weird editing choices pull us bunch different directions  final third ramps action also tries cram way many elements including setup future justice league film supposedly coming way end 2017 setup material clunky potential confusing audience members might familiar extensive comics lore mythology surrounding characters  appearances certain individuals movie poorly defined theyre likely baffling non sequiturs many  particularly disappointing musical score credited hans zimmer junkie xl aka tom holkenborg  zimmers motifs quite good man steel score reprised superman although little new development variation criminally supermans grand optimistic main theme heard end man steel simply nowhere found films score bizarre choice leaves superman characterized introspective melancholic motifs  action writing occasionally impressive often loud cacophonous thunderous percussion beating us submission  many doubt praise action stuff epic extreme little variance tone intensity starts cranked 11 pretty much stays non action stuff mostly pitched level heavy dirge tough feel battered  whats good  cant get bullet points individual moments beats great fair number tell  first movie worldclass spectacle  money screen presented cinematography legitimately oscarworthy imagery often flatout gorgeous times little dreary mileage may vary  action particularly first half full intense visceral stuff  amy adams ton relatively little script page continues make lois lane proactive interesting character  wonder woman though film much gives things fun spark energy handwringing casting gal gadot absolutely fine seems capable headlining film coming summer 2017  also jeremy irons makes fantastic slightly acerbic alfred genuine chemistry affleck  really get sense two guys trenches together long time  speaking ben affleck  without question  clear standout film pretty much worth price admission  batman new standard character judged least visual cinematic terms  way character moves fights simply thrilling exceptional choreography  coming along however level sadism violence sit right fans character  enjoy intense interpretations dark knight likely find much love way character behaves prefer view batman openly heroic may tough time swallowing transpires  affleck also brings keen intellect role movie allows character dubbed worlds greatest detective crafty capable puzzling various assortment schemes mysteries extent weve never seen batmanbruce wayne film  christian bales bruce wayne still gets slight edge side equation afflecks batman blows doors things  ultimately batman v superman dawn justice step man steel rather triumphant leap forward  yet minute minute movie goes along never compelling frequently highly entertaining ride  big fans superman prepare less transcendent handling particular character batman fans likely excited movie offer even means sitting confused muddled storytelling get it

edited better opinion however opinion never take think done impose reviews went clear head try compare bvs previous beloved dc films like dark knight marvel movies saw movie judged said would love begin review batman v superman masterpiece like dark knight like beloved marvel movies beautiful thing never never movies saw bvs five times time always positive experience true film narrative issues often cut back forth different perspectives tell overall story could confusing however bad people imply scenes quite unnecessary believe scenes better placed different part movie however still believed scenes served purpose many people saying hard follow thought fine scenes complicated reach deepest part brain realize happening viewers still give undivided attention scenes jump mighty ability human infer lost extremely fair scenes people understand unless know dc comics like scenes specifically comic readers scenes connect different part movies make sense end tell thought actors portrayal characters presented movie first would like say happy ben affleck casting batman really killed movie imo would love tell awesome batman persona would rather see judge really love portrayal bruce wayne suave sarcastic charismatic truly embodied bruces persona displayed screen henry cavill thought good part unfortunately wanted believed portrayed confused superman well superman never

beautifully important part lexs character godlike complex always wants top strongest person world apparent movie hates lose whatever deemed necessary achieve goal remain top love gal gadot enchanting wonderwoman attractive individual really gave wonderwoman divine beauty much say rather worked fighting scenes amazing stands never overshadowed drown background even around superman batman say love flirtatious banter bruce wayne love pairing wish happens alfred delight conversation bruce wayne hilarious believe also best iteration alfred dc movie history way bruce confide part vigilante crusade fun watch supporting cast brilliant believe serve purpose well laurence fishburne perry white humorous sarcastic senator finch holly hunter although little role performed amazingly characters little underused tao okamoto mercy graves literally anything scoot mcnairy really work mean get purpose felt like wasted christina wren carrie farris also useless end review go tell opinion biggest complains far love movie movie boring fun imo boring parts many things happening absolutely fine movies like action time seeing five times every time people laughing jokes clapping scenes end movie almost everyone stood clapped  people say score overly loud distracting fine soundtrack score gave emotional levity needed express needed express movie literally one best part sound design film time superman

wonderwomans guitar rift theme nasty gets pumped best part movie subtle underlying themes littered movie course one infer say definitely theme trying definitely compare events happening movie real life events problems love movies things like chris terrio goyer wrote script lot metaphor compare real life scenario absolutely love biggest complain cameos exception one little bit place mean bad placed wrong time movie edited way seems like forcing would placed proper way would nice nod add world building definitely lot attempts usher idea metahumans lack better world individuals going justice league movie however since focused characters story movie realize whole justice league stuff till end movie also really overarching story drives whole thing events happening different peoples perspective creates story whole since story told comes clusterfuck since lot scenes thrown together connect terms continuity connects together world movie definitely flaws drastically different marvel counterpart entertaining movie strive actions scenes sake actions offered thought provoking ideas paragons political statements world live explored showed possible scenario people would react creature like superman comes earth batman v superman might edited perfect execution materials made great movie exploration different characters psyche challenged different events changes perspective happens
